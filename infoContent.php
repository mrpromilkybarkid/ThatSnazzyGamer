<h2 style="text-align: center;">About Me!</h2>
<hr />
<h3 id="mainContent">
    As I said, my name Is Ben, and I am a web developer and software development. <br />
    <br />
    Other random faces about me... I love gaming and comic books. I also probably spend way too much time on Reddit. <br />
    <br />
    I love The New 52 Batman comics... Everything Batman to be honest. Apart from Batman and Robin. Batman and Robin can go away. <br />
    <br />
    I mainly play games such as WoW, Battlefield 4 and the occasional game of Black Ops 2.
